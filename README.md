I've been trying to make a bunch of smaller projects lately to cure boredom, just like a one-a-day type thing to give me some good practice using both python AND git.

When this runs, just follow the instructions, it's intuitive. Some countries don't work, that's just cause they're not in the dataset I've used.
One thing that I would go back and change if I were really bothered is that you can only use very specific full names (and a much easier one to solve, you have to capitalise the first letter.
For example, "USA" won't work, but "United States of America" will.
